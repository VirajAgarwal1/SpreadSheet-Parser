<b>Purpose Of This Project <br /></b>
This project is simple but it is helpful. I actually built this project to help my parents out in their business. Where they have dial numbers from a Spreadsheet in a column.
And since it takes time to open a spreadsheet in excel software and read through the cloumns and finding the one cloumn we want. I made this app to let them do 
this efficiently.
